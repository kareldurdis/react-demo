# React demo

Simple demo fetching a list of movies from GraphQL server and showing it. You need to have the server running locally.

## Running the server
Checkout https://github.com/kareldurdis/swapi-graphql and run it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kareldurdis/swapi-graphql.git
cd swapi-graphql
npm install
npm start
```

## Running the client
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
It should open the page automatically at http://localhost:8080/
